    ChipFiringGraph

A structure to represent the underlying graph of a chip-firing graph.

This struct provides multiple representations of the graph's structure to suit different
computational needs. It is designed for undirected, connected graphs, and the input
multiplicity matrix is expected to be symmetric.

# Fields
- `adj_matrix::Matrix{Int}`: The `n x n` multiplicity matrix, where `adj_matrix[i, j]` is
  the number of edges between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.
- `num_vertices::Int`: The number of vertices in the graph, `n`.
- `num_edges::Int`: The total number of edges in the graph.
- `adj_list::Vector{Vector{Int}}`: An adjacency list where `adj_list[i]` contains the
  neighbors of vertex `i`. This represents the underlying simple graph, meaning
  each neighbor appears only once, regardless of edge multiplicity.
- `edge_list::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(i, j)`
  represents an edge. Edges are included with their full multiplicity.
- `valency_list::Vector{Int}`: A vector where `valency_list[i]` stores the degree of
  vertex `i`, accounting for edge multiplicity.

# Constructors
- `ChipFiringGraph(multiplicity_matrix::Matrix{Int})`: Constructs a `ChipFiringGraph`
  from a square, symmetric multiplicity matrix. Throws an error if the matrix is not
  square, not symmetric, or if the graph is not connected.
- `ChipFiringGraph(num_vertices::Int, edge_list::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}})`: Constructs
  a `ChipFiringGraph` from a list of edges and the total number of vertices.

A mutable container for pre-allocated arrays and temporary data structures used in
performance-critical algorithms.

This struct is exposed for users who need to run many computations in a tight loop and
want to avoid repeated memory allocations. For one-off calculations, it is often
more convenient to use the wrapper functions (e.g., `q_reduced(g, d, q)`) which handle
workspace creation automatically.
