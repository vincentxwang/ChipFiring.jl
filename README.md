# ChipFiring.jl

This is in development so expect things to change frequently.

# Todos

- add more test cases!

# how to use?

the tldr is install julia (please use VSCode! a lot of the stuff is integrated very nicely and it's a pain to use without.)

the main draw of vscode is that you can very easily select some code and then "run it" in the environment (it's ctrl+enter on mac, i think?)

first you will need to install one dependency, which is Combinatorics. 

the easiest way to run all the code in the package is to go into ChipFiring.jl and run lines 3-8. and then you are good to use it!

see test.jl for some ideas on how to use the code, or the test folder
